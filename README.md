# Neat-Everybot2023

This is a basic implementation of 118's [Everybot](https://www.118everybot.org/2023-resources), Programmed by our new students.
The code serves as a proof of concept for algorithms such as PID and introduces the use of enums within our team's context.

**Disclaimer**:
- This code is NOT tested and may contain imperfections. Please run a couple of tests before execution, especially on the [arm's](https://github.com/NeatTeam1943/NeatEverybot2023/blob/arm/src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/Arm.java) logic.
